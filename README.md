# Project I  
# Final Project for the Project I course in the Bachelor's Degree in Analytics (Data Science) at ITBA.  
# Analysis of Fuel Prices and Volumes in Argentina.

This project aims to analyze the **historical fuel prices** at service stations across Argentina, along with the **fuel sales volumes** over the past year. In addition, news articles were taken into account to support and contrast the analyzed data, providing a more complete and contextualized view of the fuel market in the country.

## Project Description  

1. **Main Objectives**:  
   - Study the evolution of fuel prices over time.  
   - Identify patterns in sales volumes by region and service station.  
   - Validate findings with information from relevant news sources.  

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:  
   - A **comprehensive data cleaning process** was carried out to ensure high-quality analysis.  
   - Removal of inconsistent, duplicate, or incomplete data.  
   - Standardization of date formats, measurement units, and classification of stations by region.  

3. **Visualization**:  
   - The dashboard was created in **Tableau Public** to facilitate interactive visualization of the results.  
   - Dynamic charts allow exploration of:  
     - Fuel prices by province and service station.  
     - Sales volumes by fuel type (e.g., regular, premium, etc.).  
     - Temporal and regional comparisons of the data.
